This repository provides an R-based workflow organized into three interconnected analyses that cover gene expression summarization, tree growth comparison, and comparative bacterial coding sequence profiling. In the first component (gene expression summary with DESeq2), a tab-delimited matrix of raw counts (gene_expression.tsv) is read with gene identifiers set as row names and sample IDs as columns, then a minimal DESeq2 dataset is constructed using a design of ~1 to support descriptive, non-differential analysis; genes with low total counts are prefiltered, the per-gene mean expression across samples is computed and used to rank the top 10 expressed genes, the number of lowly expressed genes with mean less than 10 is tallied, and a histogram visualizes the distribution of mean expression; the principal input is gene_expression.tsv and the outputs comprise console summaries (including a printed preview of the matrix, the constructed sample table, the top-10 list, and the count of lowly expressed genes), an in-memory filtered DESeqDataSet object and a modified gene_expr data frame containing a Mean column, along with a histogram rendered to the active graphics device.

The second component examines longitudinal tree growth by loading growth_data.csv with site, tree ID, and circumference measurements at multiple years (2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020), calculating per-site means and standard deviations at 2010 and 2020, and visualizing distributions via a boxplot that compares northeast and southwest sites at those time points; per-tree 10‑year growth is computed as the difference between 2020 and 2010 circumference, mean growth is aggregated by site, and a Welch two-sample t-test evaluates whether growth differs between sites; the input is growth_data.csv and the outputs include console prints of the first rows and column names, a table of per-site mean and standard deviation for 2010 and 2020, the mean 10‑year growth per site, and the t-test results including the p‑value (for example, approximately 0.0623), as well as an augmented data frame with a Growth_2010_2020 column and a multi-group boxplot displayed to the current graphics device.

The third component performs comparative analyses of bacterial coding sequences for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by downloading or reading local CDS FASTA files, parsing the sequences, and computing core metrics such as the number of CDS, total coding DNA length, CDS length distributions, and nucleotide and amino-acid composition; it then calculates codon usage counts and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for each organism, ranks codons by the absolute difference in RSCU to highlight species-specific preferences, and visualizes these results with organism-specific top‑20 RSCU plots and a combined comparison; finally, it translates CDS to proteins, removes stop symbols, flattens to a single amino-acid vector per organism, and contrasts protein k‑mer frequencies (k = 3, 4, 5) by identifying the most enriched and most depleted motifs in S. aureus versus their E. coli frequencies; the inputs are either remote FASTA files downloaded and decompressed to ecoli_cds.fa and staph_cds.fa or local equivalents with those names, and the outputs include console tables (CDS counts, total coding lengths, mean and median CDS lengths, codon usage with RSCU and RSCU differences, and lists of top and bottom k‑mers) and multiple plots (CDS length boxplots, nucleotide and amino-acid composition barplots, top‑20 RSCU per organism and a combined RSCU comparison, and k‑mer comparisons for each k) rendered to the active device; where needed, figures can be redirected to files using pdf or png devices and tabular results can be exported with write.csv to facilitate reproducibility.
